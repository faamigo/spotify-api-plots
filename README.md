## Plotting Audio Features

This program plots audio features for all tracks of a specfic artist.

For example:
- Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 
- Danceability: A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
- Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
- Instrumentalness: Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
- Key: The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.
- Liveness: A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
- Loudness: Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
- Mode: Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
- Speechiness: The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
- Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
- Time signature: An estimated overall time signature of a track.
- Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
